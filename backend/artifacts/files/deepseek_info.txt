DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that has gained significant attention for its open-source AI models. Founded in 2023, the company has achieved remarkable success in a short period, challenging the dominance of established players in the AI industry. One of its key achievements is the development of DeepSeek-R1, an AI model that performs at a level comparable to leading models like OpenAI's GPT-4o but at a fraction of the training cost.
